 &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;The sanguine temperament is traditionally associated with air. 
People with this temperament tend to be <strong>lively, sociable, carefree,
 talkative, and pleasure-seeking</strong>. They may be <strong>warm-hearted and optimistic</strong>. 
 They can make new friends easily, be <strong>imaginative and artistic</strong>, and often 
 have many ideas. They can be <strong>flighty and changeable</strong>; thus sanguine
 personalities may struggle with following tasks all the way through 
 and be chronically late or forgetful. Pedagogically, they can be best
 reached through awakening their love for a subject and admiration of people.
